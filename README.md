### Environment Variables

For `.env` file.
- The `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` variable to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication and authorization.
- The `CONNECTION_STRING` variable is used to establish a connection to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library. 
- The `PORT` variable is used to specify the port number on which the Express.js server will listen for incoming HTTP requests.

### User Authentication

Upon logging in, users will be provided with a JWT. The JWT is used to access all the private contact APIs.

- To register a user, make a POST request to the `/api/users/register` endpoint. The request body should include the contact's username, email address, and password.

- To register a user, make a POST request to the `/api/users/login` endpoint. The request body should include the email address, and password. The request will contain a JWT.

- To access the current user information, send a GET request at the `/api/users/current` endpoint.

### Contact Usage

The Contact Management Service facilitates the following functionalities: creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts.

- To create a new contact, make a POST request to the `/api/contacts` endpoint. The request body should include the contact's name, email address, and phone number.

- To retrieve all contacts, send a GET request to the `/api/contacts` endpoint.

- To retrieve a contact, send a GET request to the `/api/contacts/:id` endpoint, where `:id` represents the contact's unique identifier.

- To update a contact's information, utilize a PUT request at the `/contacts/:id` endpoint, where `:id` represents the contact's unique identifier. Remember to include the contact's name, email address, and phone number.

- For deleting a contact, initiate a DELETE request at the `/contacts/:id` endpoint, where `:id` represents the contact's unique identifier.
